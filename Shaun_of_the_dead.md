SPOOKY NOISES...CURIOUSLY ELECTRONIC...A BELL RINGS...

INT. PUB - NIGHT
LANDLORD (O.S.)
Last orders please.
{: .dialog}
Close up on the face of a MAN. He draws on his cigarette.
{: .action}
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
Shaun?
SHAUN stares blankly into space.
SHAUN
Yeah...
{: .dialog}
WOMAN’S VOICE
Do you see what I’m saying?
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
Yeah, totally.
{: .dialog}
We reveal that SHAUN is sitting with a woman, LIZ. They are both in their late twenties. LIZ looks slightly concerned, SHAUN looks slightly confused. They are having a drink.
{: .action}
LIZ
You shouldn’t feel so responsible.
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
Yeah...
{: .dialog}
LIZ
I know he’s your best friend but you do live with him.
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
I know...
{: .dialog}
LIZ
It’s not that I don’t like Ed.
{: .dialog}
speaks off to her right
Ed, it’s not that I don’t like you.
{: .dialog}
ED
S’alright.
{: .dialog}
We reveal ED right next to them, playing a horror themed FRUIT MACHINE which bleeps spooky electronic noises. He is in his late twenties and slightly overweight.
LIZ
It’d just be nice if we could-
{: .dialog}
ED
hits the fruit machine
Fuck!
{: .dialog}
LIZ
-spend a bit more time together-
{: .dialog}
ED
Bollocks!
{: .dialog}
LIZ
-just the two of us-
ED
Cock it!
{: .dialog}
A beat.
LIZ
We have a laugh don’t we?
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
Yeah...
{: .dialog}
SHAUN and LIZ smile, sharing some private joke. SHAUN relaxes, momentarily off the hook. But...
LIZ
But with Ed always here, it’s no wonder I end up bringing my flatmates out. Then that only exacerbates things.
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
What do you mean?
{: .dialog}
LIZ
Well, you guys hardly get on do you?
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
No, what does exacerbate mean?
{: .dialog}
LIZ
It means ‘to make things worse’.
{: .dialog}
SHAUN
Oh right. Look, it’s not that I don’t like David and Di.
{: .dialog}
speaks off to his right
SHAUN
Guys, it’s not that I don’t like you...
{: .dialog}
DAVID
That’s alright.
{: .dialog}
DIANNE
That’s alright.
{: .dialog}
We reveal DAVID and DIANNE, sitting next to LIZ. Both in their late twenties, DAVID is trendy but straight-laced, DI is colourful and chirpy. They hold hands.
SHAUN
And it’s not that I don’t want to spend time with you because I do. It’s just, Ed doesn’t really have too many friends-
{: .dialog}
ED
Can I get any of you cunts a drink?
{: .dialog}
SHAUN closes his eyes.
ED
Anybody?
{: .dialog}
DAVID
No thanks.
{: .dialog}
DIANNE
No thanks.
{: .dialog}
LIZ
I’m fine thanks, Ed.
{: .dialog}
ED
Pint Shaun?
{: .dialog}
SHAUN nods. ED holds out his palm to SHAUN, who sighs and reluctantly hands him a fiver. Meanwhile, DAVID steps in.
DAVID
I know friends are important Shaun, but you’ve got to set aside quality time for just the two of you. I know I would, if I was Lizzy’s boyfriend.
DAVID looks at LIZ with affection, as DIANNE chips in.
DIANNE
Or get out more. Daffs is always taking me out to see his listed buildings, I’m always dragging him to the theatre.
SHAUN
I’m not so hot on theatre.
DIANNE
I took my students to see this great new play about incest. Very cool. Lots of swearing.
LIZ
He’s not so hot on theatre.
DIANNE
Well, how about a nice meal? You could go to that restaurant me and Daffs go to. The place that does all the fish. It’s your anniversary soon isn’t it?
DAVID
It was last week.
DIANNE
Oh, so did you do anything special?
LIZ
We came here.
SHAUN
Yeah, but that was just me and you.
LIZ
And Ed.
SHAUN
He wasn’t with us.
LIZ
He was sitting at the bar. It’s not the same.
ED (O.S.)
Shauny, hog lumps!
A packet of Pork Scratchings hits SHAUN square in the face.
LIZ
Shaun, what I’m trying to say is, I need something a little more.
SHAUN offers her a Pork Scratching. She declines.
LIZ
More than spending every night in the Winchester. I mean, I’m 29.
LIZ
I’ve got things I want to do with my life, I want to get out there, do more interesting stuff, live a little, but I’d love to be able to do it with you, but I want you to want to want to do it too.
LIZ laughs grimly at her own silly sentence. She then takes a pork scratching and regards SHAUN with a mixture of exasperation and affection.
LIZ
I don’t want to go on at you, Jesus, listen to me. I’m beginning to sound like your Mum. Not that I’d know what she sounds like.
DAVID
You still haven’t met his Mum?
SHAUN
Not Yet.
DAVID
I can’t believe you haven’t met his mum.
LIZ
It’s not that simple.
DIANNE
Don’t you get along with your Mum, Shaun?
SHAUN
It’s not that I don’t get along with her-
DAVID
Are you ashamed of your Mum, Shaun?
SHAUN
No I’m not, I love my Mum.
ED
returning with drinks
I love his Mum.
SHAUN
Ed-
ED
She’s butter.
SHAUN
Ed!
DAVID
Shaun-
DIANNE
Shaun-
SHAUN
Guys-
LIZ
Shaun-
SHAUN
Liz.
holds up his hands
I totally understand what you’re saying and I agree, really I do. We should get out there. Do more interesting stuff. Together. We’ll start tomorrow, I’ll book a restaurant. The place that does all the fish. We’ll do it properly. Just the two of us. Things’ll change. Promise.
LIZ
Really Shaun?
The LANDLORD calls time. SHAUN stares back into space.
LIZ (O.S.)
Shaun?
The BELL rings again. The SPOOKY NOISES continue as...
TITLES BEGIN
A MONTAGE OF GREATER LONDON, Saturday 8 A.M. (All actions in the sequence are choreographed to the TITLE MUSIC)
...A traffic jam. Drivers stare blankly ahead. A MIDDLE AGED MAN sits in a Jag wearing DRIVING GLOVES...
...A bus stop. BORED COMMUTERS ignore each other...
...A vast supermarket car park. Customers park up as a bow tied OLD MAN slowly collects discarded trolleys...
...A 24 hour supermarket serves earlybird customers. A vacant CHECKOUT GIRL bleeps products through her till...
...A nightclub in an industrial estate expels its last patrons. DAZED YOUNG CLUBBERS wander into the daylight...
...A nondescript suburb. A BORED KID kicks a FOOTBALL against a wall. We CLOSE IN on a semi-detached house...
INT. HOUSE - DAY
Bare feet shuffle into shot. Slowly we PAN UP to see-
SHAUN. Dead to the world. His face tired. He yawns.
We are in the lounge. The decor is male, the room untidy. ED is sitting on the sofa, playing a video game.
He may have been there all night. SHAUN sits next to him, picks up a game controller and presses a button. A VOICE booms.
GAME VOICE
Player two has entered the game.
ED
Haven’t you got work?
SHAUN puts the controller back down.
GAME VOICE
Player two has left the game.
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
A TOILET is flushed...a SHOWER run...TEETH brushed...
SHAUN now wears a white short-sleeved shirt. He straightens his tie in the mirrored door of the bathroom cabinet, which is ajar. He shuts it.
PETE stands in the reflection. His face like thunder.
PETE
You do know the front door was open again last night?
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
A DRAWER is yanked open...A KNIFE grabbed...TOAST buttered. A BOTTLE OF MILK hits the table. PETE screws the lid on.
PETE
I’m not saying it was you.
SHAUN
I know man but-
PETE
I’m saying it was Ed.
SHAUN
Right.
PETE returns the milk to its rightful place in the fridge. He also wears a shirt and tie, but is somewhat smarter.
PETE
I can’t live like this. Look at the state of it. We’re not students anymore.
SHAUN
Pete-
PETE
It’s not like he even brings any real money into the house.
SHAUN
He brings a bit.
PETE
What, dealing drugs?
SHAUN
Come on. He sells a bit of weed every now and again. You’ve sold puff.
PETE
Once! At college! To you! Anyway, I did a lot of stupid things at college Shaun. I dressed up as Frank N. Furter, I drank snakebite and black, I slept with a fat girl. Doesn’t mean I want to do any of them for a living.
SHAUN
Look I’ve known him since primary school. I like having him around. He’s a laugh.
PETE
What because he can impersonate an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.
SHAUN
What?
PETE
He’s dead weight Shaun.
SHAUN
Oh leave him alone.
PETE
Okay, I admit, he can be pretty funny on occasion. I had a great time that night we sat up drinking Apple Schnapps and playing Tekken 2.
SHAUN
Yeah, when was that?
PETE
Five years ago. When is he going home?
ED
Whassup niggaz?
ED enters and takes the milk from the fridge, he swigs from the bottle and wanders out, scratching his nuts.
SHAUN
I’ll have a word.
INT. LOUNGE - DAY
SHAUN sits down by ED, who is again playing the video game.
PETE watches at the door.
SHAUN
Hey man, listen...top left...
ED
Thanks.
SHAUN
...I was just going to say...reload!
ED
I’m on it.
SHAUN
...since you’re...ooh nice shot.
ED
Thanks.
SHAUN
Since you’re in most of the day-
ED’s mobile rings (ring tone: ‘HALLOWEEN’).
ED
Two seconds.
answers
Alright Noodle...No I only got an ‘enry. Shortage on...Alright. Laters.
ED resumes his game. PETE’s seen enough and wades in.
PETE
Ed, since you’re not working at the moment, could you please clean up a bit?
ED
I am working.
PETE
Since you are in the flat all the time do you think you could clean up a bit?
ED
Yep.
PETE
And if you play the answer machine, could you take down everyone’s messages, not just your own?
ED
Yep.
PETE
It’s not that taxing is it? Writing something on a ‘post-it’ note?
ED
Nope.
PETE’s mobile rings as he leaves (ring tone: ‘LIVE FOREVER’ by Oasis). He puts on his jacket. On the back is a ‘post-it’ reading - ‘I AM A PRICK’
SHAUN sees this and shakes his head wearily at ED.
ED
Come on. It was pretty funny.
SHAUN
Seriously, will you do what he said?
ED
I ain’t doing nothing for him.
SHAUN
Well, do it for me then.
ED
pauses game
I’m sorry Shaun.
SHAUN
It’s okay.
ED
No, I’m sorry Shaun.
SHAUN puzzles, before his expression turns to disgust.
SHAUN
Oh man that’s bad. You’re rotten.
ED laughs. SHAUN does too, as he covers his nose and mouth.
ED
I’ll stop doing them when you stop laughing.
SHAUN
I’m not laughing. I’m going.
SHAUN leaves. The phone rings. The answer machine picks up.
PETE (V.O.)
Hi, you’re through to Peter and Shaun. Please leave a message after the –
Beep. PUSH IN as the RED LIGHT flashes.
LIZ (V.O.)
Hello Shaun, it’s me. Look I’m going to be tied up a bit today, I’ve got twenty year ten essays to mark and I want to get them out of the way, so when you book the table, can you make it eight rather than seven?
LIZ (V.O.)
You’re probably not there anyway. I’ll try you at work. so...okay. Bye, bye. Bye. Bye.
CLOSER. The RED LIGHT flashes. The screen is filled.
EXT. STREET – CONTINUOUS
BANG. A FOOTBALL hits SHAUN in the head. He turns to see the BORED KID grinning at him. He responds playfully.
SHAUN
Oh you’re dead!
SHAUN boots the ball back. He walks past PETE in his car and crosses the road. He heads for the newsagent passing a HOMELESS MAN in a green coat with a dog on a lead. He stands with an ARM OUTSTRETCHED. SHAUN gives him some change.
